 * Bluegrass Commercial Door & More: local & state code suggestions for the door builder.
 * Short, plain-English things worth checking with the inspector for the doors a customer built,
 * each with the code section and a link to the source. Suggestions only: nothing here blocks a
 * choice or a quote request, and the local inspector (authority having jurisdiction) has the final say.
 *
 * Codes these notes are based on (checked Sep 2026):
 *   Kentucky, commercial   815 KAR 7:120 = 2018 Kentucky Building Code (KBC) 4th Ed., based on the 2015 IBC.
 *                          Uniform statewide: local governments can't adopt a different building code.
 *   Kentucky, homes        815 KAR 7:125 = 2018 Kentucky Residential Code (KRC) 3rd Ed., based on the 2015 IRC.
 *   Kentucky, existing     815 KAR 10:060 Kentucky Standards of Safety (NFPA 1 and NFPA 101), State Fire Marshal.
 *   Tennessee, commercial  Rule 0780-02-02-.01: 2021 IBC with changes (Chapter 11 removed, Section 423 not required);
 *                          local jurisdictions that enforce their own current codes are exempt.
 *   Tennessee, homes       State Fire Marshal residential program: 2018 IRC (new homes and additions; local opt-out).
 *   Everywhere             2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design; NFPA 80 (fire doors); FEMA P-361 / P-320 and ICC 500 (safe rooms).
 *
 * Each rule: id, where (jurisdiction groups), use ("business" | "home" | "both"), when(door, ctx) for door rules
 * (project rules have no when), and say(ctx, doorInfo) returning the text; src(ctx) returns [{cite, url}].
 * Works in the browser (window.CodeChecks) and in Node (module.exports).
